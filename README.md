# CS108-Fall-2018
Graded Homework Projects (GHP) from my first CS college course at SUNY Polytechnic Institute. 

Notes:
These Graded Homework Projects Start off with relatively simple Assignments Such as Converting Fahrenheit into Celsius and Monthly Car Payment Calculations.
Towards the end of the semester we were working on a basic understanding of Linked Lists and Structs.
